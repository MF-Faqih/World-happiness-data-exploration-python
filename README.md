# World-happiness-data-exploration-python

World happiness index is the measurement of happiness level of people in the country. There's some factor that can influence the happiness indexm such as generosuty, perception of corruption, health expectation and may more. As the analysis result I conclude that:
- The more higer the happiness index, the more higher the positife facctor
- Ranking of happiness level from 2005 until 2021 doesn't seems change too much.
